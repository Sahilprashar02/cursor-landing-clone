# Cursor Landing Page Clone

This repository contains a clone of the Cursor landing page, built exactly to the specified assignment requirements. The project focuses on recreating the visual design and layout using only pure HTML and CSS.

## 🏗️ Sections Recreated

I have successfully built the following 11 sections as requested:

1.  **Top Navigation Bar**: Includes logo, navigation links, and primary CTA buttons with a dark background.
2.  **Hero Section**: Features the main headline, description, CTA button, and a large product video/screenshot.
3.  **Trusted By / Logos**: A row of company logos (Stripe, OpenAI, etc.) displayed in a grid.
4.  **Feature Sections**: Three blocks with a two-column layout (alternating text and video/image) showcasing core features.
5.  **Feature Cards Section (Feedback)**: A grid layout displaying testimonials/quotes with user details.
6.  **Testimonials**: Integrated into the feedback section as quota cards.
7.  **Use Cases / Stories (Frontier)**: Cards with images and short text highlighting model access and enterprise features.
8.  **Changelog**: A list of recent updates with version numbers and dates.
9.  **Team / About (Join Us)**: A section with a call-to-action to join the team, featuring a large team photo.
10. **Final CTA**: A distinct download section with a large heading and a single button.
11. **Footer**: A multi-column layout containing links, company info, and legal text.

## 🎨 Design System

I have matched the original design's aesthetic closely using the following system:

### 🔤 Fonts

- **Primary Font**: `CursorGothic`
- **Fallbacks**: `CursorGothic Fallback`, `system-ui`, `Helvetica Neue`, `Arial`, `sans-serif`

### 🎨 Color Palette

- **Backgrounds**:
  - Page Background: `#14120b` (Dark Theme)
  - Card Background: `#1b1913` / `#1d1b15`
  - Card Hover: `#201e18`
- **Typography**:
  - Primary Text: `#edecec`
  - Secondary Text: `#d7d6d5`
- **Accents**:
  - Links/Highlights: Orange (`rgb(245, 78, 0)`), Red (`rgb(233, 62, 62)`)

## ✨ Code Quality & Formatting

To ensure the codebase is professional and easy to maintain:

- **Standardized Indentation**: All HTML and CSS files use a consistent **2-space indentation** pattern.
- **Clean Structure**: Semantic HTML5 tags are used throughout to provide meaningful structure.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Extensive comments are added to explain the purpose of each section and the reasoning behind specific styling choices.

## ⚠️ Constraints Adherence

This project rigorously follows the assignment constraints:

- ✅ **No Frameworks**: Pure CSS, no TailwindCSS.
- ✅ **No AI Generation**: Code was written manually.
- ✅ **No Animations**: Static implementation (except for standard CSS hover states).
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Includes tablet and mobile media queries for the footer and layout refinements.
